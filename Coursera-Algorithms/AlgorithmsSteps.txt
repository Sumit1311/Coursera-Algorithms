Union-Find Data Structure : 

Milestone 1 : Implement using individual points pointing to leader vertex



Maintain a vector of vertices index (as vertex ) and value at index should be parent and no of vertices with given parent.


Find : return the value at given index

Union : update the parent pointers of of the group with less no of members.


Create a struct called Vertex :
	Data members : value, parentPointer.
Create a class named Group :
	Data members : name, vectorOfVertices.
	(Create a vector to maintain groups of vertices. All the vertices in the vector should have same parent vertex).
