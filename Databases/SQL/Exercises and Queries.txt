1. Find the titles of all movies directed by Steven Spielberg
	select title from movie where director='Steven Spielberg';

2. Find all years that have a movie that received a rating of 4 or 5, and 		sort them in increasing order
	select distinct year
	from movie natural join rating
	where stars = 4 or stars = 5
	order by year;

3. Find the titles of all movies that have no ratings. 
	select title
	from movie natural join rating
	where ratingDate is null;

4. Some reviewers didn't provide a date with their rating. Find the names 	   of all reviewers who have ratings with a NULL value for the date. 
	select reviewer.name
	from movie natural join rating natural join reviewer
	where ratingDate is null;

5. Write a query to return the ratings data in a more readable format: 			reviewer name, movie title, stars, and ratingDate. Also, sort the data, 	first by reviewer name, then by movie title, and lastly by number of 		stars. 
	select name,title,stars,ratingDate
	from movie natural join rating natural join reviewer
	order by name,title,stars

6. For all cases where the same reviewer rated the same movie twice and 		gave it a higher rating the second time, return the reviewer's name and 	the title of the movie. 
	select name,title
	from movie natural join rating r1 natural join reviewer
	where
